/**
 * Defines the methods required to interact with the golem hook system.</br>
 * The {@code handlerData} object can be anything that you would like and will never be touched by anything
 * other than the {@code IGolemHookHandler} that created it. It simply serves as a means to attach instance
 * data to a golem. <br/>
 * <hr/>
 * <strong>Keeping data synchronized.</strong><br/>
 * If you have data that you need to send to the client, you can register that data when {@Link #addDefaultSyncEntries} is called. In order to reduce the
 * amount of data that is sent to client, you can only register individual characters of data.<br/>
 * Keep in mind that the handlerData on the server-side will not automatically match the handlerData on the client side. You must perform the
 * synchronization yourself. The only data shared between the server and client are the registered sync characters.<br/>
 * <strong>Example situation</strong>
 * <ol>
 * <li>[BothSides] Handler receives call to {@link #addDefaultSyncEntries}<br/>
 * Registers character with default value of 'n'<br/>
 * Receives ID of 13.</li>
 * <li>[Server] Handler receives call to {@link #customInteraction} an creates a complex object as its handler data.</li>
 * <li>[Server] Handler receives call to {@link #setupGolem}.<br/>
 * Handler sees that it's handlerData is not null, and verifies the data.<br/>
 * Handler then sets character ID 13 to 'y'</li>
 * <li>Data is sync'd and both sides have a value of 'y' in character ID 13.</li>
 * <li>[Client] Handler receives call to {@link #onSyncDataChanged}<br/>
 * Handlers sees that character ID 13 has a value of 'y'<br/>
 * Handler then sets its handlerData to String("Active")</li>
 * <li>[Client] Handler receives call to {@link #renderGolem}<br/>
 * Handler sees that its handlerData is not null, verifies that it equals String("Active")<br/>
 * Handler then performs its render.</li>
 * </ol>
 * In the above situation, the handlerData on both sides differs, but the complex object is only need on the server side. The client only needs to
 * know that the server-side handler has placed a 'y'(yes) value in the sync data, and therefore the server expects all clients to perform the special
 * render.<br/>
 * Following the above situation, if later during a call to setupGolem the server-side handler sets the sync character to 'n'(no), when the client
 * receives the update, the client-side handlerData can be set to, for example, null. This will let the handler know to not perform the special
 * render.<br/>
 * </br>
 * If you want to see an example of a class that implements this, lookup my {@code WirelessGolemHandler} class on the ThE github.
